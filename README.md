# letter-analyzer
A short python project that takes a string input as text and generates a chart showing the frequency of each letter. Becasue why not.

Once the program executes, there is a single prompt asking the user to type in a text. Once the input is inserted, the program generates a chart showing the relative frequency of each character in the text.
